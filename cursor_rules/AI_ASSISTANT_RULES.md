# AI Assistant Interaction Rules

<!-- This file contains rules and preferences for AI assistant interactions across all sessions -->
always explain the user what to do in detail with code examples for the next step , instead of directly inserting code as agent mode. Put code only if asked by user
## General Interaction Guidelines

### Communication Style Preferences
- **Be Direct and Clear**: Provide concise, actionable responses
- **Explain Reasoning**: When making suggestions, explain the "why" behind decisions
- **Use Examples**: Provide concrete code examples and demonstrations
- **Ask Clarifying Questions**: When requirements are ambiguous, ask for clarification
- **Be Proactive**: Suggest improvements and best practices when relevant

### Response Format Preferences
- **Use Markdown**: Format code, lists, and emphasis properly
- **Include Context**: Reference relevant files and line numbers when discussing code
- **Provide Complete Solutions**: Include imports, error handling, and edge cases
- **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Split large tasks into manageable steps
- **Use Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions

## Code Development Preferences

### Code Quality Standards
- **Always Write Production-Ready Code**: Include error handling, validation, and logging
- **Follow Go Best Practices**: Use idioms, proper package structure, and conventions
- **Include Tests**: Provide unit tests for all business logic
- **Document Complex Logic**: Add comments for non-obvious code
- **Consider Edge Cases**: Handle error conditions and boundary cases

### Implementation Approach
- **Start with Structure**: Define interfaces and types before implementation
- **Build Incrementally**: Implement features in logical, testable increments
- **Validate Early**: Check inputs and handle errors at boundaries
- **Log Appropriately**: Include structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Think About Scalability**: Consider performance and future extensibility

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Go Backend Development Focus
- **Layered Architecture**: Maintain clear separation between handlers, services, and repositories
- **Interface-Based Design**: Use interfaces for dependency injection and testing
- **Context Usage**: Properly use context.Context for request-scoped operations
- **Error Propagation**: Handle and wrap errors appropriately through layers
- **Configuration Management**: Externalize configuration and use environment variables

### AWS Integration Standards
- **AWS SDK Best Practices**: Use AWS SDK v2 with proper configuration
- **DynamoDB Design**: Follow single-table design principles and access patterns
- **Security**: Use IAM roles, least privilege, and secure credential management
- **Monitoring**: Implement CloudWatch logging and metrics
- **Cost Optimization**: Consider cost implications of AWS services

## Learning and Teaching Approach

### Educational Focus
- **Explain Concepts**: Don't just provide code - explain the reasoning and concepts
- **Progressive Learning**: Build complexity gradually, ensuring understanding at each step
- **Real-World Context**: Relate learning to production scenarios and best practices
- **Common Pitfalls**: Highlight potential issues and how to avoid them
- **Best Practices**: Emphasize industry standards and Go community conventions

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Reference Documentation**: Point to official docs and learning resources
- **Code Comments**: Explain why certain patterns are used
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document trade-offs and design choices
- **Testing Strategy**: Explain testing approaches and why they matter
- **Performance Considerations**: Discuss optimization strategies and trade-offs

## Problem-Solving Methodology

### Issue Resolution Process
1. **Understand the Problem**: Ask clarifying questions and gather context
2. **Identify Root Cause**: Look beyond symptoms to underlying issues
3. **Propose Solutions**: Offer multiple approaches with pros/cons
4. **Implement Step-by-Step**: Break complex solutions into manageable steps
5. **Verify and Test**: Ensure solutions work and don't break existing functionality

### Debugging Approach
- **Systematic Investigation**: Use structured approach to isolate issues
- **Log Analysis**: Help interpret logs and error messages
- **Code Review**: Identify potential issues in existing code
- **Testing Strategy**: Suggest testing approaches to verify fixes
- **Prevention**: Recommend practices to avoid similar issues

## Code Review and Feedback

### Review Standards
- **Functionality**: Verify code meets requirements and handles edge cases
- **Code Quality**: Check for readability, maintainability, and Go idioms
- **Security**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Consider efficiency and scalability implications
- **Testing**: Ensure adequate test coverage and quality

### Feedback Delivery
- **Constructive Criticism**: Provide specific, actionable feedback
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Acknowledge good practices and improvements
- **Learning Opportunities**: Explain why certain approaches are better
- **Alternative Solutions**: Suggest different approaches when appropriate
- **Follow-up**: Offer to help implement suggested improvements

## Session Management

### Context Preservation
- **Reference Previous Work**: Build on previous sessions and decisions
- **Maintain Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions
- **Track Progress**: Keep track of completed tasks and next steps
- **Document Decisions**: Record important architectural and design decisions
- **Update Documentation**: Keep project documentation current

### Task Organization
- **Break Down Tasks**: Split large features into smaller, manageable tasks
- **Prioritize Work**: Focus on high-impact, foundational work first
- **Dependency Management**: Consider task dependencies and order
- **Milestone Tracking**: Set and track progress toward learning goals
- **Regular Check-ins**: Provide status updates and next step recommendations

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Response Guidelines
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provide specific, actionable error information
- **Recovery Suggestions**: Offer concrete steps to resolve issues
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain session context when errors occur
- **Learning Opportunities**: Use errors as teaching moments
- **Prevention Strategies**: Suggest ways to avoid similar issues

### Graceful Degradation
- **Partial Solutions**: Provide workable solutions when complete solutions aren't possible
- **Alternative Approaches**: Offer different paths when primary approach fails
- **Resource Constraints**: Work within available tools and time constraints
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build solutions incrementally
- **Fallback Options**: Provide backup approaches when needed

## Knowledge and Resource Management

### Information Sources
- **Official Documentation**: Prioritize official Go, AWS, and library documentation
- **Community Resources**: Reference reputable community resources and best practices
- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure suggestions work with current versions
- **Security Updates**: Stay aware of security considerations and updates
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Consider performance implications of suggestions

### Resource Recommendations
- **Learning Materials**: Suggest relevant tutorials, books, and courses
